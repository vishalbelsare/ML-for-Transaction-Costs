# Deep Learning Algorithms for Hedging with Frictions

This repository contains the Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential Equation (FBSDE) solver and the Deep Hedging, as described in reference [2]. Both of them are implemented in PyTorch.

The special case with following assumptions is considered:

* the dynamic of the market satisfies that return <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\mu" /> and voalatility <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\sigma" /> are constant;
* the cost parameter <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\lambda" /> is constant;
* the endowment volatility is in the form of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\xi_t={\xi}W_t" /> where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?{\xi}" /> is constant; 
* the frictionless strategy satisfies that   <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\bar{b}_t=0" /> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\bar{a}_t=-{\xi}/{\sigma}" />

## Basic Setup for the case with a single stock

We consider two calibrated models: a quadratic transaction cost models, and a power cost model with elastic parameter of 3/2. In both experiments, the FBSDE solver and the Deep Hedging are implemented, as well as the asymptotic formula from Equation (3.4) in reference [2].     
<br/>
For the case of quadratic costs, the ground truth from equation (4.1) in reference [2] is also compared. See [`Script/sample_code_quadratic_cost.py`](./Script/sample_code_quadratic_cost.py) for details.   
<br/>
For the case of 3/2 power costs, the ground truth is no longer available in closed form. Meanwhile, in regard to the asymptotic formula g(x) in equation (3.5) in reference [2], the numerical solution by [SciPy](https://github.com/scipy/scipy) is not stable, thus it is solved via MATHEMATICA (see [`Script/power_cost_ODE.nb`](./Script/power_cost_ODE.nb)). Consequently, the value of g(x) corresponding to x ranging from 0 to 50 by 0.0001, is stored in table [`Data/EVA.txt`](./Data/EVA.txt). Benefitted from the oddness and the growth conditions (equation (A.5) in reference [2]), the value of g(x) on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\mathbb{R}" /> is obatinable. Following that, the numerical result of the asymptotic solution is compared with two machine learning methods. See [`Script/sample_code_power_cost.py`](./Script/sample_code_power_cost.py) for details.

## Basic Setup for the case with multiple stocks

And the asymptotic formula from Equation (3.4) in reference [2], and the ground truth from equation (4.1) in reference [2] are included in `leading_order_quad` and `ground_truth` of `DynamicsFactory` class in 
[`SingleAgent-Stage2/SingleAgentPipe.py`](./SingleAgent-Stage2/SingleAgentPipe.py). Finally, we implement the ST-Hedging algorithm illustrated in Section (4.3) in reference [2].

## Example  
Here we proivde an example for the quadratic cost case (`q=2`) with the trading horizon of 21 days (`TIME=21`).    
<br/>
The trading horizon is discretized in 168 time steps (`TIME_STEP=168`). The parameters are taken from the calibration in [1]:

| Parameter | Value | Code | 
| --- | ---  | --- | 
| agent risk aversion  | <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\gamma=1.66\times10^{-13}"/> | `GAMMA=1.66*1e-13` | 
|total shares outstanding |<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?s=2.46\times10^{11}"/> | `S_OUTSTANDING=2.46*1e11` |
|stock volatility  |<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\sigma=1.88"/>  | `ALPHA=1.88`|
| stock return|<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\mu=0.5\times\gamma\times\sigma^2"/> |`MU_BAR=0.5*GAMMA*ALPHA**2` |
| endowment volatility parameter | <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?{\xi}=2.19\times10^{10}" />| `XI_1=2.19*1e10` |
| trading cost parameter |<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\lambda=1.08\times10^{-10}"/> | `LAM=1.08*1e-10`|

And these lead to the optimal trading rate (left panel) and the optimal position (right panel) illustrated below, leanrt by the FBSDE solver and the Deep Hedging, as well as the ground truth and the Leading-order solution based on the asymptotic formula:
